            <p> I am a small business owner with a vibrant eccomerce business that sells vintage sewing patterns and embroidery supplies for crafters looking for an authentic vintage style. We are <a href="https://www.vintage4me2.com/" target="_blank">Vintage4me2.com.</a></p>

            <p>Our business journey began in 1999 when my partner, best friend and mother opened a stall in an antique store called "Clothes to Home". It was at this time that Ebay was becoming a phenomen and things were selling like crazy. We were skeptical at first but we created an Ebay account after a splurge purchase of Royal Copenhagen China. When we sold the china for 10 times it's purchase price, we were hooked; though it did occur to us that maybe fine china wasn't the best thing to sell.</p>

            <p>Like many Ebayers, we started going to antique auctions, malls and estate sales looking for anything that caught our eye. One day, Judy Yates was antiquing on Miracle Mile in Stockton, Ca and found six 1930s evening gown patterns; the kind of gowns that movie stars like Carole Lombard would wear to the Oscars. She bought them and we listed them on Ebay to a very enthusastic market. Vintage patterns were it for us; they were easy to ship, fun to sell and had a committed group of costumers and collectors to buy them. </p>

            <p> We have come a long way in the 20 years. I recieved a degree in History from the University of California, Berkeley in 2006 and joined the company as a partner. We have grown from an "Ebay Seller" to a four platform eccomerce business that sells on Ebay, Etsy, Vintage4me2.com and directly on Facebook. We have over 30,000 followers on social media and have worked to create a space on facebook for other sewing enthusiatists to chat, trade knowledge, humble-brag and most importantly, buy more patterns.</p>

            <p> After this class I want to bring the eccomerce skills I have already and my new coding skills to improve my business and create visually captivating pages for other small businesses. </p>
